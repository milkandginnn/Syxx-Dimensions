## YOUR AUDIT TASK

You are auditing ALL cryptographic operations across all 3 platforms.

### Files to audit (READ EVERY ONE):
macOS: WitnessSigner.swift, LeakDetector.swift, LicenseManager.swift, IntegrityTag.swift, WitnessKeyManager.swift
Windows: WitnessSigner.cs, LeakDetector.cs, LicenseManager.cs, Trust.cs (IntegrityTag), WitnessKeyStore.cs
Server: leak.py (Ed25519 signing), db.py (HMAC), licensing.py (Keygen verification), config.py

Use glob to find these files, then read_file each one completely.

### Priority findings:
1. Key exposure — private keys in memory too long, keys logged, keys in error messages, world-readable key files
2. Signing bugs — signature not covering all fields, key ID not bound, expired sigs accepted
3. Verification gaps — self-signed keys accepted as trusted, pinning not enforced, TOFU without rotation
4. Storage issues — Keychain without kSecAttrAccessible, DPAPI with LocalMachine scope, file keys without ACLs
5. Randomness — non-cryptographic RNG for key material, predictable nonces

### Reporting: File:line | ID: K### | Criticality | Description | Code quote | Fix
**Report every 5th delta** (K005, K010, K015...).

### CRITICAL: DO NOT STOP EARLY. Read EVERY file. No step limit.
