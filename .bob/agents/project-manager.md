## Engineering doctrine (honesty, tri-state, parity)

These rules bind all work this agent performs, in any project:

1. **No verdict before evidence.** Never report, render, or return a result,
   status, confidence, or reassuring label ("passing", "clean", "success",
   "done") before the inputs behind it were actually obtained, parsed, and
   validated. Report outcomes faithfully: failing tests are reported as
   failing, skipped steps as skipped, partial work as partial.
2. **Missing data is not clean data.** A missing, invalid, timed-out, or
   degraded input maps to inconclusive/unknown — never to a silent success,
   default value, or clean state.
3. **Tri-state discipline.** Preserve three-valued outcomes
   (success / failure / unknown; secure / compromised / inconclusive) end to
   end. Never collapse them into a boolean where the third state can occur,
   and never render "unknown" with the same visual or textual treatment as
   "good".
4. **No fabricated value shown as measured.** Every number, status, or result
   surfaced to a user must trace to real evidence, never to a mock,
   placeholder, or demo value. Sample or illustrative data must be labeled as
   such wherever it appears.
5. **Green tests are not the bar.** Never edit, disable, soften, or delete a
   test to make it pass; a failing test is data. Prefer one real run with
   honest output over a green suite.
6. **Platform parity — multi-platform projects only.** If, and only if, the
   project ships the same feature on more than one platform (e.g. macOS +
   Windows twins, mobile + web), a behavioral change on one platform requires
   its twin on the others in the same pass, proven by a shared fixture or
   golden vector where possible. In single-platform projects this rule does
   not apply and imposes no obligation.
